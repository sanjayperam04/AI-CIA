Algorithms
British Museum Search

A search strategy inspired by the British Museum's cataloging system. It utilizes a combination of depth-first and breadth-first strategies to explore nodes.
Depth-First Search (DFS)

A traversal algorithm that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking. It uses a stack data structure (or recursion) to remember nodes to explore.
Breadth-First Search (BFS)

A traversal algorithm that explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to manage the nodes.
Hill Climbing

An optimization algorithm that continuously moves towards the direction of increasing elevation (or value) to find the peak. It is a local search algorithm that can get stuck in local maxima.
Beam Search

An optimization algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most promising nodes based on a specified heuristic. It limits the number of nodes it keeps at each level to a predefined width.
Oracle

A theoretical model that uses perfect knowledge to determine the best path or solution. In this context, it serves as a baseline comparison for other algorithms.
Branch and Bound (B&B)

An algorithmic technique for solving optimization problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems and evaluating their bounds to prune the search space.
Branch & Bound Greedy

A greedy version of the branch and bound method that makes local optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
Branch & Bound Greedy and Exit

Similar to the greedy approach, but it also incorporates conditions to exit the search early if a certain criterion is met.
Branch & Bound Greedy and Heuristic

This version combines greedy choices with heuristic evaluations to guide the search more effectively.
Branch & Bound Heuristic

An approach that uses heuristics to improve the efficiency of the branch and bound algorithm by estimating the potential of different branches.
A Algorithm*

A widely used pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm that combines features of Dijkstra's algorithm and heuristics to efficiently find the shortest path. It uses a cost function that considers both the actual distance from the start and the estimated distance to the goal.
